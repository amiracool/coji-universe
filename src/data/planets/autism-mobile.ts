      "Autism isn't a flaw in how you connect or think. It's a different operating system ‚Äî one that notices patterns others miss, feels emotions in full colour, and processes the world with both clarity and overwhelm.",
      "Your brain prefers directness over hints, depth over small talk, and routines that help you navigate a world built for different wiring."

    fullContent: [
      "Autistic minds process sensory input, social cues, and information differently. What others tune out (background noise, fabric textures, tone shifts) can feel amplified. What others find intuitive (sarcasm, implied meanings, social scripts) can feel like guesswork.",
      "This isn't deficiency ‚Äî it's perceptiveness paired with different filters. You might hyperfocus on special interests, forming encyclopedic knowledge and genuine passion. You might struggle with transitions and surprises, needing predictability to function at your best.",
      "Many autistic people describe feeling like they're translating a foreign language in social settings, masking their natural responses to fit in. This takes energy, and after socialising (even enjoyable socialising), you may need deep recharge time."
