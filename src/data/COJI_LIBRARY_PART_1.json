          "Hyperfocus isn't a superpower when you forget to eat, sleep, or go to the loo. It's a dysregulation that needs management.",
          "ADHD brains are interest-based, not importance-based. You can't just 'decide' to focusâ€”your brain needs novelty, urgency, or passion.",
          "Did you know ADHD can affect your sense of hunger, thirst, and needing the toilet? Interoception struggles are common.",
          "Time blindness means you genuinely don't know if something took 5 minutes or 50. It's not poor planningâ€”it's neurology.",
          "ADHD often comes with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), making criticism feel devastating even when it's mild.",
          "Did you know ADHD can make transitions feel like climbing mountains? Task switching drains energy most people don't even notice using.",
          "ADHD brains crave stimulation. 'Fidgeting' and 'distraction' are often your brain trying to create the dopamine it needs to focus.",
          "Did you know emotional regulation is part of ADHD? Your feelings can feel overwhelming because your brain struggles to modulate intensity.",
          "ADHD often means you experience 'time optimism'â€”thinking you have more time than you do, leading to chronic lateness.",
          "Sleep problems are neurological with ADHD. Your brain doesn't produce melatonin on schedule, making bedtimes genuinely difficult."
