**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** Significant Progress - Core Features Complete

---

## 🎯 Overview

This session delivered major improvements to Coji Universe with a focus on:
- Mobile-first optimization
- Educational content structure
- New Ideas & Questions feature
- Performance improvements (skeleton loaders, desktop-only animations)
- Legal/compliance updates (wellbeing terminology, finance disclaimers)

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Terminology Update: Therapy → Wellbeing

**Why:** Reduce legal liability by clarifying Coji doesn't provide licensed therapy.

**Changes Made:**
- `CojiUniverse.tsx`:
  - "Access therapy tools" → "Access wellbeing tools"
  - "Therapist Booking" → "Wellbeing Appointment Booking"
  - "therapy info" → "wellbeing resources"
  - "Types of Therapy" → "Wellbeing Approaches"
  - Variable: `selectedTherapy` → `selectedWellbeingService`
- `parenting.ts`: "therapy or support groups" → "wellbeing support or peer support groups"
- `depression.ts`:
  - "Medication and therapy" → "Medication and wellbeing support"
  - "Try therapy (CBT, DBT...)" → "Try professional support (CBT, DBT...)"

**Preserved Medical Terms:**
- "Physiotherapy" (medical treatment)
- "Speech therapy" (medical treatment)
- "Occupational therapy" (medical treatment)

---

### 2. Skeleton Loaders for Loading Optimization

**Purpose:** Improve perceived performance, reduce loading jank, smoother UX.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/skeletons/SkeletonCard.tsx`
- `src/components/skeletons/SkeletonPlanetGrid.tsx`
- `src/components/skeletons/SkeletonList.tsx`
- `src/components/skeletons/SkeletonForm.tsx`
- `src/components/skeletons/SkeletonText.tsx`
- `src/components/skeletons/index.ts` (barrel export)

**Features:**
- Mobile-first design
- Staggered animation delays for natural loading feel
- Accessible (aria-labels, role="status", sr-only text)
- Variants for different content types
- Minimal DOM footprint

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { SkeletonPlanetGrid, SkeletonForm } from '@/components/skeletons';

{isLoading ? <SkeletonPlanetGrid count={6} /> : <PlanetGrid data={planets} />}
```

---

### 3. Educational Section Component

**Purpose:** Structured education for each planet following 3-part framework.

**File Created:** `src/components/library/EducationalSection.tsx`

**Structure:**
1. **Understanding It** - Explain the condition in kind, plain language
2. **How It Affects Daily Life** - Real-world challenges and adaptive traits
3. **Planning Ahead** - Practical strategies (jobs, accessibility, healthcare, planning)

**Features:**
- Collapsible sections (mobile-first, touch-friendly 44px+ buttons)
- Icons for visual clarity (Book, Calendar, Briefcase, Home, Stethoscope)
- Optimal readability (60-70 character line length, 16px+ font)
- WCAG AA contrast
- Accessible (aria-expanded, keyboard navigation)

**Educational Content Created:**
- `src/data/educational/adhd-educational.ts` ✅
- `src/data/educational/autism-educational.ts` ✅
- `src/data/educational/index.ts` (barrel export) ✅

**Remaining Content Needed:**
- `dyspraxia-educational.ts`
- `anxiety-educational.ts`
- `depression-educational.ts`
- `dyscalculia-educational.ts`
- `chronic-illness-educational.ts`

---

### 4. Ideas & Questions Planet

**Purpose:** Let users submit ideas, questions, and feedback directly to Coji team.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/library/IdeasQuestionsPage.tsx`
- `src/app/library/ideas-questions/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Simple, lightweight form
- Auto-captures user email from auth (`supabase.auth.getUser()`)
- Category selection (feature_request, question, feedback, bug_report, other)
- Stores in Supabase `ideas_and_questions` table
- Success/error states with animations
- Mobile-first (44px+ buttons, readable text, accessible inputs)
- Loading state during submission
- Responsive grid of info cards

**Supabase Schema:**
Already exists in `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` (lines 24-79):
- Table: `ideas_and_questions`
- RLS policies: users can only CRUD their own submissions
- Indexes on user_id, status, created_at

**Route:** `/library/ideas-questions`

**TODO:** Add to navigation/library grid

---

### 5. Desktop-Only Planet Animations

**Purpose:** Improve mobile performance, reduce battery drain, smoother mobile experience.

**Files Created:**
- `src/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts` - General media query hook
- `src/hooks/useIsDesktop.ts` - Desktop detection (>= 1024px)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/PlanetOrb.tsx`
  - Added `useIsDesktop()` hook
  - Updated animation logic: `shouldAnimate = !prefersReducedMotion && isVisible && isDesktop`
  - Animations now ONLY run on desktop (1024px+)
  - Still respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Animations Affected:**
- Planet float
- Orbit ring rotation
- Emoji spin
- Shimmer effect
- Pulse glow

**Mobile Behavior:**
- Static planets (no animation)
- Reduced battery usage
- Faster rendering
- Better touch performance

---

### 6. Chronic Illness Planet Title Update

**Purpose:** Remove emoji from title text (emoji stays in planet orb).

**File Modified:** `src/components/library/ChronicIllnessPage.tsx`
- Changed: "Welcome to the Chronic Illness Resources Planet"
- To: "Chronic Illness Resources"
- Cleaner, more professional presentation

---

### 7. Finance Disclaimer Updates

**Purpose:** Legal clarity that Coji doesn't provide financial advice.

**Verified Existing Disclaimers:**
- **Home Page (line 2674):**
  "Wellbeing-focused budgeting and planning tools (not financial advice — consult a licensed professional for investments or debt management)"

- **Finance Tab (lines 4616-4621):**
  ```
  Important: Coji does not offer financial advice, but rather tools and
  strategies for wellbeing, budgeting, and planning. For debt management,
  investments, or financial advice, please consult a licensed financial
  professional.
  ```

**No changes needed** - disclaimers already in place and prominent.

---

### 8. Supabase Schema Debugging

**Issue:** Policy "Users can view their own tracking_data" already exists

**Fix Applied:** `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
- Added `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before every `CREATE POLICY`
- Makes schema idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Applied to:
  - `ideas_and_questions` policies (4 policies)
  - `eisenhower_matrix_tasks` policies (4 policies)

**Schema is now production-ready.**

---

## 🔍 Technical Notes

### Animation System
- **CSS Animations** (Tailwind): float, orbit, spin-very-slow, pulse-slow, shimmer, slide-up, fade-in, scale-in
- **Controlled by:**
  - `useReducedMotion()` - respects user preference
  - `useIntersectionObserver()` - only animates visible elements
  - `useIsDesktop()` - NEW: only animates on desktop
- **Performance:** GPU-accelerated with `will-change`, minimal repaints

### Form Handling
- **Pattern:** Controlled components with useState
- **Validation:** Required fields, trim whitespace
- **Feedback:** Success (3s auto-dismiss), Error (persistent until retry)
- **Accessibility:** Labels, ARIA, min height 44px, semantic HTML

### Supabase Patterns
- **Auth:** `supabase.auth.getUser()`
- **Insert:** `supabase.from('table').insert(data)`
- **RLS:** User ID checked server-side
- **Error Handling:** Try/catch, user-friendly messages

### Responsive Design
- **Breakpoints:** sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- **Mobile-first:** Default styles for mobile, scale up
- **Touch targets:** Minimum 44px x 44px
- **Typography:** 16px base, 60-70ch line length

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Patterns

### Mobile-First Design Principles Applied
1. **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px x 44px for all interactive elements
2. **Typography:** 16px base font (prevents mobile zoom on input focus)
3. **Line Length:** 60-70 characters for optimal readability
4. **Spacing:** Generous padding/margin on mobile, tighter on desktop
5. **Navigation:** Thumb-friendly placement, bottom or top

### Performance Optimization Patterns
1. **Lazy Loading:** Components load when needed
2. **Intersection Observer:** Animate only visible elements
3. **Media Queries:** Different experiences for different devices
4. **Skeleton Screens:** Better than spinners for perceived performance
5. **GPU Acceleration:** `will-change` for animated elements

### Accessibility Patterns
1. **Semantic HTML:** Use `<button>`, `<form>`, `<label>` correctly
2. **ARIA:** `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `role="status"`
3. **Screen Readers:** `sr-only` class for context
4. **Keyboard:** Tab order, focus management, Enter/Space handlers
5. **Motion:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
